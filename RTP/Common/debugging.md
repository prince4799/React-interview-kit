### React Developer Tools (React DevTools)

**React Developer Tools** is a browser extension that allows developers to inspect and debug React applications.

#### 📌 Features:
- **Component Inspection**: View the component hierarchy and inspect props, state, and hooks.
- **State Management Debugging**: Modify state and props in real-time.
- **Profiler**: Analyze component render performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Highlight Updates**: Visualize component updates to optimize rendering.
- **Hooks Support**: Inspect and modify values of `useState`, `useEffect`, and other hooks.
- **Context API Debugging**: View and manipulate context values.

#### 🚀 How to Install:
- Chrome Extension: [React DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- Firefox Extension: [React DevTools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

#### 🎯 Usage:
1. Open **DevTools** in your browser (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in Chrome/Firefox).
2. Navigate to the **React tab**.
3. Inspect, modify, and debug React components.

### Flipper for React Native

**Flipper** is a debugging platform for mobile applications, including React Native. It provides a set of built-in plugins and supports custom plugins for deep debugging.

#### 📌 Features:
- **React DevTools Integration**: Similar to browser DevTools but for React Native apps.
- **Network Inspector**: Monitor API requests and responses in real time.
- **Layout Inspector**: Inspect and debug UI layout issues.
- **Logs Viewer**: View and filter logs from both the JavaScript and native side.
- **Database Inspection**: Analyze SQLite, AsyncStorage, and other storage options.
- **Crash Reporting**: Collect and analyze crash reports.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identify UI slowdowns and memory leaks.

#### 🚀 How to Install:
1. Download and install Flipper: [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/)
2. Install dependencies in React Native:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev react-native-flipper
   ```
3. Run the application and open Flipper to start debugging.

#### 🎯 Usage:
1. Start your React Native app.
2. Open **Flipper** and connect your device/emulator.
3. Use available plugins to debug network, layout, logs, and performance.
