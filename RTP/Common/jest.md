## âœ… What is Jest?  
Jest is a **JavaScript testing framework** designed for unit, integration, and snapshot testing. It is widely used in **React and React Native** applications due to its speed, built-in assertions, and ease of use.

## ðŸš€ Why Use Jest?  
- **Zero Config** â†’ Works out of the box with minimal setup.  
- **Fast & Parallel Testing** â†’ Runs tests in parallel for better performance.  
- **Snapshot Testing** â†’ Captures UI snapshots and detects unexpected changes.  
- **Mocking & Spying** â†’ Easily mocks functions, modules, and timers.  
- **Code Coverage Reports** â†’ Generates test coverage reports for analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features  
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Tests individual functions and components. |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensures different parts of the app work together. |
| **Snapshot Testing** | Captures UI component output and checks for changes. |
| **Mocking** | Simulates external dependencies like API calls. |
| **Code Coverage** | Measures how much code is tested. |

## ðŸ”¥ Common Jest Methods  
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `test()` / `it()` | Defines a test case. |
| `expect()` | Defines expected behavior. |
| `toBe()`, `toEqual()` | Compares values. |
| `jest.fn()` | Creates a mock function. |
| `beforeEach()` / `afterEach()` | Runs setup/cleanup before/after tests. |

## âš¡ Best Practices  
âœ… Keep tests **independent** to avoid dependencies.  
âœ… Use **mocks** for API calls and external dependencies.  
âœ… Ensure proper **test coverage** to catch edge cases.  
âœ… Use **descriptive test names** for better readability.

## ðŸ“Œ When to Use Jest?  
- **React & React Native** component testing.  
- **Testing utility functions and business logic.**  
- **Mocking API requests and external libraries.**  

Jest is **one of the best tools** for testing React-based applications due to its **simplicity, speed, and extensive ecosystem**. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
