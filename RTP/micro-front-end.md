## üîπ What is Micro Frontend Architecture?
Micro Frontend (MFE) is an architectural approach where a frontend application is divided into smaller, independently deployable units, similar to microservices on the backend. Each unit (or micro frontend) is built, deployed, and maintained separately, then integrated into a single user experience.

## üîπ Why Use Micro Frontends?
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Enables teams to work on different parts of the app independently.
- **Technology Agnostic** ‚Äì Different teams can use different technologies (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
- **Independent Deployment** ‚Äì Micro frontends can be updated and deployed independently.
- **Code Reusability** ‚Äì Promotes modularity and reusability of UI components.
- **Parallel Development** ‚Äì Teams can develop and deploy features faster without conflicts.

## üîπ Challenges of Micro Frontends
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Overhead** ‚Äì Increased HTTP requests and dependency management may affect performance.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Communication Complexity** ‚Äì Managing state and communication between micro frontends can be tricky.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Styling Conflicts** ‚Äì CSS clashes can occur between different micro frontends.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent UX** ‚Äì Different teams may implement different UI/UX patterns.

## üîπ Implementing Micro Frontends in React
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Module Federation (Webpack 5)**
- Allows dynamically importing components or entire apps at runtime.
- Efficient for sharing dependencies across micro frontends.
- Example: `ModuleFederationPlugin` in Webpack.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Single-SPA**
- A JavaScript framework for orchestrating micro frontends.
- Supports multiple frameworks in a single app.
- Uses lifecycle methods to mount/unmount micro frontends.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ iframe-Based Approach**
- Each micro frontend is embedded inside an `<iframe>`.
- Ensures isolation but may introduce performance issues.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Elements (Web Components)**
- Uses Web Components to create encapsulated UI components.
- Ensures styles and scripts do not interfere with each other.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Routing Composition**
- Centralized router (like React Router) that delegates navigation to different micro frontends.
